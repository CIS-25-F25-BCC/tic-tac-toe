Understanding the Code

1. What does getCell(int row, int col) return if you pass invalid coordinates like (-1, 5)?

	The getCell function will return the '\0' char

2. What does getWinner() return when there's no winner yet?

	The getWinner() function will return a space char ' '

3. Explain why getWinner() is marked const but makeMove() is not.

	getWinner() is const because it does not change any data / it has no side-effects.
	makeMove() is not const because it changes board, moveCount, & currentPlayer variables

4. If the board is full but nobody has won, what should isGameOver() return?

	isGameOver() should return true, false || true == true

5. What value does getCurrentPlayer() return at the start of a new game?

	The TicTacToe constructor sets currentPlayer to 'X', 
	so getCurrentPlayer() should return char 'X' at the start of a new game
