1.It will return '\0' when (x<0 || x>=3 || y<0 || y >=3)
and because tictactoe has 3x3 so if x or o move out of that
it will return '\0'

2.getWinner() will return nothing when there is no winner
because there is no display function for that.

3.getWinner() is marked const but makeMove() is not
because const will keep variable x or o can't be change to qualify to get winner
but makeMove() need to change direction so it can't keep variable

4.isGameOver() will return nothing if pass by getWinner() and return 9 if pass by isFull().

5. getCurrentPlayer() return X at the start of the game.
